My computer crashed a few months back and the data from hard disk was not 
recovered. So to cut a long story short I've had to restart from scratch in
learning frontend development.

It's so true that if you don't practise something you will lose that skill, so 
right now I'm practising doing changes and saving these changes to GITHUB using 
the git commands in Terminal.

        > git add .
        > git commit -m "making changes to files and commiting them to repository"
        > git push

Started to practise with CSS in particular FLEX-BOX.

Started to practise with CSS layout scenarios using
        display-flex
        justify-content
        align-items
        flex-wrap
        flex-direction
and so on so on....
