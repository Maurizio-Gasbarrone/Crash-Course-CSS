My computer crashed a few months back and the data from hard disk was not 
recovered. So to cut a long story short I've had to restart from scratch in
learning frontend development.

It's so true that if you don't practise something you will lose that skill, so 
right now I'm practising doing changes and saving these changes to GITHUB using 
the git commands in Terminal.

        > git add .
        > git commit -m "making changes to files and commiting them to repository"
        > git push
